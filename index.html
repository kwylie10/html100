    <h1>How to Survive a Compliance Review</h1>
    <h3>Understanding the Process</h3>
      <p>Compliance reviews are one of the most challenging parts of working as as Safety Director for a national trucking company.
      It is important to understand the reason your company has been selected for the review. The main reason a trucking company
      is selected for compliance review is due to high CSA scores and or a series of serious trucking safety events.
      </p>
      <h3>Most Common Safety Events to Trigger a Compliance Review</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>CSA Crash percentage over 65</li>
